    <p>This is my first blog post. Today, I found a subreddit which has deals on various parts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales">required to build a pc</a>. Surprisingly, it also has deals on pc-setup peripherals like chairs and tables. All post titles seem to have a title in their category name (ssd, mouse, chair etc.).

<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<p>I started looking into the reddit API to see how I can parse through all of the submissions on a subreddit. Found the official documentation to be very underwhelming. I did find this  wrapper on the API, <a href="https://github.com/pushshift/api">pushshift</a>, which can help me get what I need. Seems like I need to make a single GET request to this wrapper and it will return a list of json objects that I can then parse.</p>

<h4 id="deciding-what-framework-and-language-to-use">Deciding what framework and language to use</h4>
<p>I’ve been using Java spring boot at work recently, so I am most fluent in that at the moment but that seems like a bit of overkill for this app. I think I will use react for this though. I learnt that recently but never really built anything with it(except for the demo application in the <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact">coursework</a>). If I do only front-end though, I will have query and parse the api on every page load. I don’t think this subreddit gets that many submissions to warrant such frequent updates. I could make a small backend in python that pre-processes new posts everyday and then my front-end can just query this backend without having to parse and pre-packaged data. Maybe there is a way to do this pre-packaging in react for at least distinct user sessions? Not sure, but for now, I’ll let it be only front-end.</p>

<p>If its too slow, I can think about having a backend. So <strong>react</strong> it is!</p>
