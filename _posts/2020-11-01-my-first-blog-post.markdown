This is my first blog post. Today, I found a subreddit which has deals on various parts [required to build a pc][reddit-buildapcsales]. Surprisingly, it also has deals on pc-setup peripherals like chairs and tables. All post titles seem to have a title in their category name (ssd, mouse, chair etc.). I'll try to build a parser that can segregate the posts by category, making it easier for myself to keep track of things I am interested in. I plan to keep this blog as a live document, updating it along the way as a way to track my progress and keep me motivated to do this. Excited to get started tomorrow!
